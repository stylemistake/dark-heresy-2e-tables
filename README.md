# Holy Rulebook

A collection of rules for the Dark Heresy inspired board game, with a
complete solution for managing character sheets.

## Pre-requisites

- Node `^8.8`
- Yarn `^1.3.2`

## Installation

This will launch the development server:

```
yarn start
```

Usage of the `holy-rulebook` executable:

- `bin/holy-rulebook` - launch a production server
- `bin/holy-rulebook --build` - just build
- `bin/holy-rulebook --dev` - launch a development server
- `bin/holy-rulebook --clean` - clean build artifacts

## Notes

Need to migrate lots of data from Holy Excel 2E.
