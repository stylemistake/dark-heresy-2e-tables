type: skill
name: acrobatics
aptitudes:
  - agility
  - general

description: |
  Acrobatics covers feats of agile movement, graceful motion, and mastery of balance and form. With this skill, characters can leap nimbly across gaping chasms, maintain their balance on a pitching ship deck, or fall gracefully to the ground without snapping their limbs. In combat, an accomplished acrobat can somersault, flip, or cartwheel away from foes, twisting his body out of reach of his enemy or slipping past foes in a blur of motion. Often, characters develop a knack for Acrobatics as part of their training in another field. A courier or thief might learn these knacks as part of travel through densely populated areas. Gladiators, survivalists, and dancers need to be able to perform acrobatic motions as part of their daily routines. Even a Tech- Adept accustomed to working in particularly confined quarters devotes his daily flesh- exhortations to improving flexibility, so that he might more effectively work within narrow ductwork.

  The GM can call on a player to use the Acrobatics skill when:

  - He must keep his balance or avoid falling in unstable ground.
  - He wishes to jump down from a height and land well.
  - He wants to move over or around a foe or obstacle in his path without breaking his stride.

usages:
  - name: contortionist

      A character can use his Acrobatics skill to escape from bonds or the grip of a foe by twisting and turning his body. As a Full Action, a character may make an Acrobatics skill test to free himself from bonds, such as rope, manacles, or the like. This test can only be attempted once to escape restraints; if the character fails to free himself the first time, then he is simply too tightly bound and unable to contort his way free. The GM can modify this test depending on the quality of the bonds in this situation. Characters may also use Acrobatics to escape from a grapple (see page 221) by using their Acrobatics skill instead of their Agility or Strength when grappling.

      In combat, a character capable of acrobatics can more easily avoid foes or retreat from combat without harm. The character may make a Disengage action (see page 220) as a Half Action (rather than a Full Action) if he passes a Challenging (+0) Acrobatics skill test.

  - name: jumping
    description: |
      A well-trained acrobat excels at jumping, leaping, and lessening the effect of falls by folding his body as he hits the ground. When jumping or leaping (see page 222), a character may use the Acrobatics skill in the place of Agility and Strength tests. When determining Falling damage, a character can make an Acrobatics skill test to reduce the effective distance fallen by a number of metres equal to his Agility bonus.

  - name: pursuit parkour
    description: |
      An agile acrobat can parkour over most obstacles much faster than other people. If you are have the Trained, Experienced or Veteran advances on the Acrobatics skill, you take less penalties on Pursuit tests due to hard terrain. In this case, you may reduce the hard terrain penalty by the amount of the bonus that you gain for these advances. This cannot reduce the hard terrain penalty below 0, and will not give you additional bonuses.
