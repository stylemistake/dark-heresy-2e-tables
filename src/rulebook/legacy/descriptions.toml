description = "The Acolyte can focus his intent on where it is likely to do most damage to his enemy and then strike his foe down with a single shot. Before making a ranged Standard Attack action, he can spend a Fate point. If he does so, he adds the number of degrees of success scored on the attack test to both his damage and penetration for the hit."

title = "Face in a Crowd"
description = "A successful investigation often involves trailing suspects without their knowledge, the better to follow them to hidden dens of heretical worship or criminal activity. With training, the Acolyte can ensure none notice his presence, through careful replication of a crowd’s mannerisms or even joining gatherings while still keeping a careful eye on his quarry. When employing the Shadowing special use of the Stealth skill, he can use his Fellowship characteristic instead of his Agility."

[[descriptions]]
title = "Flash of Insight"
description = "Despite steady application of logic and careful analysis, some conundrums remain insoluble, but inspiration could come from outside sources, such as reading patterns from wisps of lho smoke or even making direct appeals to the Emperor for guidance. An Acolyte who has trained his mind to process such lateral data can leap to conclusions that direct thinking cannot provide, and thus quash even the most hidden of heresies. When stuck in an investigation, he can spend one Fate point to reveal a single clue or lead to aid in the progression of his efforts."

[[descriptions]]
title = "Frenzy"
description = "The Acolyte’s temper and passion boil just below the surface of his psyche, mostly held in check by his rational mind, but easily released when needed. If he spends one full round fuelling his anger—by flagellation, drugs, or other means—on the next round, he goes into an uncontrolled rage, gaining a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness, and Willpower, but suffering a –20 penalty to Ballistic Skill, Intelligence, and Fellowship. Note that characteristic penalties are different from characteristic damage (see page 188), and cannot reduce a characteristic below 1. While Frenzied, the character must attack the nearest enemy in melee combat if possible. If he is not engaged with the nearest enemy, he must move towards that enemy and engage it if possible. He will not take obviously suicidal actions such as leaping off a building in order to engage someone on the ground, but he will take any actions that offer a reasonable opportunity to engage in melee with the nearest enemy. While Frenzied, he is immune to Fear, Pinning, Stunning effects, and the effects of Fatigue; he cannot Parry, retreat, or flee. He remains Frenzied for the duration of the combat, and cannot use psychic powers while Frenzied. After combat ends, or if there are no more eligible enemy targets for the character to attack, he can make a Willpower test to snap out of his Frenzy. If he fails, he must continue to attack, favouring NPCs over PCs. Each successive round, however, he can make another Willpower test, with a cumulative +10 bonus to return to a stable state of mind and come out of Frenzy. After Frenzying, he cannot Frenzy again for at least an hour, as he recovers his mental and physical strength."

As a Full Action, he can both move up to his Full Move rate and make a single attack with a ranged weapon. This attack can only be a single shot, and so cannot be a semi- or full-automatic ranged attack for example.

Though there are many different types of mechadendrites, this talent divides them into two broad categories: • Weapon: Mechadendrites of this type end in either ranged or close combat weapons, and have the supplemental power supplies and mechanical support necessary for combat. • Utility: Including such varied types as Manipulator, Medicae, Utility, Optical, and countless others, these generally require less hardy mountings, but all function in a similar manner."

He may spend one Fate point to ignore the effects of injury (such as those from Critical damage), Fatigue, and Stunning for a single combat, so long as they would not kill him immediately.

The GM and player may agree to award this talent when appropriate to the adventure or campaign, though the character must still pay the experience cost for the Talent as normal. This talent can be awarded multiple times for the same group, in which case it should be listed as Peer (X), with X equalling the number of times the talent has been awarded.
